A set of tools to assist in Taylor Mahler's research paper. The following programs provide content pipelines for the research and can select dialogue of dyads, lines, scenes, and so on. These features will be added as needed, so stay tuned. Further, the format of the shakespeare play to be used is based on Folger text versions of the play available online.

Enjoy!
